Another project whilst im learning the basics of C -- The goal is to build a program that I can take notes with in class (practise questions for exams) sort them and then generate practise tests.

Class Buddy: first design of the programm to take notes during class / study sesh, and turn them into a text file at the end.
______________
To come: Exam Buddy (where the exams would be generated with the notes) - Answer buddy (to go through the answers after test gerenations) and some soret of tracker to keep track of progress, or other attributes.
