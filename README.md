Study Buddy
---------
Another project whilst im learning the basics of C -- The goal is to build a program that I can take notes with in class (practise questions for exams) sort them and then generate practise tests.
_______________
Class Buddy: first design of the programm to take notes during class / study sesh, and turn them into a text file at the end.
______________
Exam Buddy: taking the generated text for Class buddy and generates different test with it
____________________________
To come: Improving exam by allowing spaces in files, better randomness (as i wanted to give random seed generation myself a go first), getting ride of the black infomation, and a printing test function - Class buddy, but allowing numbers to be typed first while recording - Answer buddy (to go through the answers after test gerenations) and some soret of tracker to keep track of progress, or other attributes.
